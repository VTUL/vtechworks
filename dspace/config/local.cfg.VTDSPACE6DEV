# EXAMPLE "local.cfg" for DSpace.
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the DSpace *.cfg files. This includes overriding
# settings in any of these files:
#    * [dspace]/config/dspace.cfg
#    * Or any configuration file that is included in 'dspace.cfg'
#     (See "include = [filepath]" settings near the end of dspace.cfg.
#      By default, it includes all [dspace]/config/modules/*.cfg files)
#
# By default, this EXAMPLE file includes a number of commonly overridden configurations.
# * ADD configurations by simply copying them into this file from any existing *.cfg file.
# * REMOVE configurations by simply commenting them out or deleting them below.
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "dspace.dir" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "dspace.dir" in the dspace.cfg file.
# Similarly, including "oai.solr.url" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "oai.solr.url" in the modules/oai.cfg file.

# Full link your end users will use to access DSpace. In most cases, this will be the baseurl followed by
# the context path to the UI you are using.
#
# Alternatively, you can use a url redirect or deploy the web application under the servlet container root.
# In this case, make sure to remove the /${dspace.ui} from the dspace.url property.

# Solr server/webapp.
# DSpace uses Solr for all search/browse capability (and for usage statistics by default).
# The included 'solr' webapp MUST be deployed to Tomcat for DSpace to function.
# Usually it will be available via port 8080 and the 'solr' context path. But,
# But, you may need to modify this if you are running DSpace on a custom port, etc.

# DATABASE CONFIGURATION #
##########################
# DSpace only supports two database types: PostgreSQL or Oracle

# Database username and password
db.username = dspace
db.password = dspace

# Database Schema name
#    * For Postgres, this is often "public" (default schema)
#    * For Oracle, schema is equivalent to the username of your database account,
#      so this may be set to ${db.username} in most scenarios.

# HANDLE CONFIGURATION #
########################
#
# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# Items in DSpace receive a unique URL, stored in dc.identifier.uri
# after it is generated during the submission process.
# 
# If you register with CNRI's handle service at http://www.handle.net/,
# these links can be generated as permalinks using http://hdl.handle.net/
# as canonical prefix. Please make sure to change handle.canonical.prefix
# after registering with handle.net by uncommenting one of the following
# lines, depending if you prefer to use http or https:
# handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/
# handle.canonical.prefix = https://hdl.handle.net/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.

# settings from authentication.cfg. But you may uncomment whichever plugins you
# need in order to change the default settings (or reorder them below).
#
# You may also copy default settings from the corresponding authentication-*.cfg
# configuration file and override them in this local.cfg.

# IP-based authentication/authorization. See authentication-ip.cfg for default configuration.
