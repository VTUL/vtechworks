# EXAMPLE "local.cfg" for DSpace.
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the DSpace *.cfg files. This includes overriding
# settings in any of these files:
#    * [dspace]/config/dspace.cfg
#    * Or any configuration file that is included in 'dspace.cfg'
#     (See "include = [filepath]" settings near the end of dspace.cfg.
#      By default, it includes all [dspace]/config/modules/*.cfg files)
#
# By default, this EXAMPLE file includes a number of commonly overridden configurations.
# * ADD configurations by simply copying them into this file from any existing *.cfg file.
# * REMOVE configurations by simply commenting them out or deleting them below.
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "dspace.dir" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "dspace.dir" in the dspace.cfg file.
# Similarly, including "oai.solr.url" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "oai.solr.url" in the modules/oai.cfg file.
